# Horiseon Social Solution (Refactoring)

## Changes:
```
* There were multiple classes with same functions but different names, made one class out of those similar classes.
* one of the navigations was missing ID, ID created for "search-engine-optimization".
* Alt attribute added for all images.
* Replaced all Div elements with semantic elements.
* changed the footer's heading element from h2 to h4.
* changed the Title to "HoriSEOn" which represents both company name and what company does.
* Add comments to css codes.
* Finish the read me file.
```

## Challenges:
```
1. Commenting all codes, specially not knowing if they all need comments.

2. Deciding which semantic elements to use to replace Div elements.

3. I had to move my Index and asset folder inside repository multiple times in order to have my live URL open without error.
